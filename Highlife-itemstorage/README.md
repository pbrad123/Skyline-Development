# Highlife-itemstorage. Items with Storage!
This resource says what it does on the box, Items with their own storage.

If you want a backpack that you can store items in, this can do it.

If you want a pizza box to put pizza into, this can do it.

If you want a cigarette box with cigarettes already in the pouch, this can do it.

If you want me to give you $100, you are in the wrong place.
